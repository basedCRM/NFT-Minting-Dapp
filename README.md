This minting Dapp was created by following this tutorial:

In order to make this work, you need to have some artwork created, as well as .json files. 
For this project, they are hosted on fleek. 

Ex: 
https://storageapi.fleek.co/4f9743ce-d4c0-4c96-8917-d32196fb5396-bucket/Archetypes/0.json

This style of minter is one where someone calls a Mint() and then there is a sequence for the tokenURI -- which is the address of the .json file listed above.
